    <h3>About Me </h3>
    
  </p>
<p> This is a pretty basic website that I have to do for my first HTML class. I'll use this time to tell you a little about myself.</p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>My username for most things is HiImPaul, like that monkey from <i>Jimmy Neutron</i>.</li>
      <li>I am <b>26</b> years old, and had originally pursued a career in sales prior to coming back to school.</li>
      <li>I have two super cute dogs, a Border Collie names Somi and an Lab mix named Sadie!</li>
  </p>

  <p>
    For ne next part we can talk about my favorite food and favorite music. I honestly love most music and I am really not to picky, but lately I have really been into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphia"> Polyphia </a> 

  <p>
    For my favorite foods it would have to be:
    <ol style= "1">
      <li><a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/new-york-style-pizza">Pizza!</a></li>
      <li>Pizza.</li>
      <li>and more Pizza.</li>
